I read in some reviews people comparing it to Game Of Thrones but other than being it a medieval costume fantasy story there is nothing comparable to it. It's a totally different story, very entertaining if you are into that kind of stuff, which I am, with a lot of weird creatures, bizarre characters, and good battles. The two main characters are played by Henry Cavill and Anya Chalotra. Henry Cavill is perfect for that role, the rest of the cast are all contributing to a good new show, that will definitely have a lot of fans, a bit like GOT and probably the same fans. I can't wait to watch another season, hopefully the quality remains at the same level as the first season and then we're up for much more seasons, hopefully...",

I don't know the games nor the books but as a fantasy show The Witcher is solid but in no way a masterpiece like many claim: the action scenes are good but the dialogues (like some other reviewers state) are boring as hell, it is really difficult to follow all that blablabla, most times my mind just wanders away till some action is going on. The time jumping of the storytelling is also sometimes (especially at the beginning and if you don't know the books and games like me) really confusing. Anyway, the show grew with every episode on me and is in my opinion good if you are into very fantasy (some good action, good production), if not, don't bother.",

It is a dark fantasy, but the magic is consistent as is, for the first season, the storytelling. It's its own world and it's a good one. I never knew about the Witcher until I saw the trailers and then buzzed through the season. Not a bad performance and Yennefer and Geralt are the primary characters. Henry Cavil shows his acting chops and the rest of the cast is really well done. There is one dragon, and it's nothing like the beasts from GOT. This dragon is more like a cousin of Smaug, and the more classical dragons. Well worth watching.",

As the series begins there are concerns about a child who has gone missing; something that mirrors events of thirty three years ago... this could be the set-up of any mystery series but soon things take a strange turn; another boy enters a cave and emerges thirty three years in the past and the body of a boy is found, he is dressed entirely in '80s clothing. What follows is a story were more people use the caves to travel in time; characters interact with people they know at different ages... sometimes they even interact with their older/younger selves. It is only a matter of time before they learn that a disaster is coming; will they be able to prevent it or will they be caught in a strange time-loop forever?",

It's a mystery crime, but a real good one. I don't know any of the German actors, don't know if they are famous in their country, but they sure can act. I thought they were all very good and all of them added something different to the story. A story that you have to watch very closely, without any disturbance and without losing your attention. Because if you do you won't be able to follow the story anymore. It's all a bit complicated and weird but in a good way. Certainly one of the better shows in this genre that I saw this year. The soundtrack is just excellent. It really adds something to the dark ambiance. I don't know if there will be a second season, it looks like it, but I'm certainly a fan and will for sure watch the next season if there is one. Class show!",

There is just too much drama between all the characters. Drama isn't bad, but teenage drama is something else, it's something annoying to watch when past a certain age. The concept is about the same as the success series Dexter, following a sociopath that is convinced he's doing great things, and this with the narrating voice of the sociopath, in this case played by Penn Badgley, that narrates you everything he does and thinks. It worked better with Dexter than with You, but that's just something about quality. For the rest the story isn't that bad, but it could have been much better. I guess there will be a second season, one that I probably will watch in the hope it gets better, but I have my doubts about that.",

Well, people still are longing for feelings and recognition, where technology can be both of assistance and hindrance, but at times - as we see in this Series - even fatal. And contrary to what many people believe, smartphones are not for vanity fair only - even people who read books (so old-fashioned in the 21th century?) need them from time to time, to live a fancier life, not being stuck in inner space or in some imaginary world. The characters seem realistic, the performances more than average (some male ones even good, e.g. Penn Badgley as Joe Goldberg, Luca Padovan as Paco), but as for the script, the drawing power began to fade for me, with some eyebrows-raising scenes when I really started to question the US police´s acting and failure to acting; come on, the events take place in a big city, not in a distant sparsely-populated area! A certain private detective did not add convincingness too much either. Well, I realize that I am not a member of the target group, so only 7 points from me. But you never know, I might even watch Season 2 when ready - as there is enough material for seguel.",

Characters development was rushed with unexpected deaths that did not leave any emotional impact to the characters you know from several seasons. I felt like the showrunners swayed far away from the first five seasons. First five seasons was great and kept you hooked. But this season dropped the ball. With a boring story. Boring directions that felt like a lot of time filler episodes. And one of the worst season finales.",

It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think.",

Most of the scenes are (literally) down to Earth, with no fancy visual effects. It spends much time building up the story, telling the story of a father and his daughter who sees 'ghost' in her bedroom. Through this ghost, one thing led to another, and the man is in space. When the film is not down on Earth, it looks more like a disaster film. The first adventure is a spectacular feat involving water. It also introduces the physics of relativity, on how time slows down in another world, leading to a misguided decision of the astronauts in retrospect. This sets the foundation for future plot involving more relativity.",

This sequel is a loud and frantic mess, where superpowers can do whatever the plot demands, characters don't care about consistency, and the same jokes are repeated a dozen times.

I like the Carnage as character, but I wish it was a tougher and gore movie. The relationship between Edin and Venom were like romantic comedy relationship. I don't like rap and I didn't like the main music of the movie. The after credits scene of the movie was shocking, I didn't expect it at all. Anyway, enjoy the movie, it's not a serious movie, but after the after credits scene, it made me very curious.",

Andy Serkis direction flowed perfectly with large budgeted carnage. Length is just right too has the right scenes needed nothing boring at all or otherwise. I'm impressed Tom Hardy voiced Venom, plays Eddie Brock, has a writing credit, and is a producer that's wild! Hope my thoughts are appreciated either way highly recommend this fun time experience.",

This had too much CGI and carnage, and not enough story to balance it. The entire 'bite' thing seemed like lazy writing and I'm sure a little more creativity would've gone a long way. Still a decent one-time watch. Hardy nails it as always. It's a 7/10 from me.... I Like Trains",

You have in this movie many unexpected things, but the overall scheme remains à James Bond movie, maybe more than SKYFALL, which was far far more a crime thriller than an OO7 feature. Watch it again and compare. In a way, SKYFALL announced this one, with SPECTRE in the middle. Not the best Bond ever, but not the worst either.",

No, this is a perfect dose of escapism; intense, emotional and brimming with action. It picks up the best hanging threads from Casino Royale and Skyfall, throws in some callbacks to classic Bond movies and allows Craig to leave an immense mark on this franchise. I'm thankful that he didn't walk away after Spectre, and really delivered something to savor here. Given the runtime, this could've been a last gasp - but far from it. This is a joyride well worth taking.",

Her parents can't find anybody but starts eating anyways. She refuses and walks off when she meets a boy called Haku. He implores her to leave across the water before nightfall. She's too late and the dry riverbed becomes a vast river. The park becomes inhabited by spirits. Haku sends her to boiler-man Kamaji and tells her to beg for a job with the ruthless witch Yubaba who runs the magical bathhouse.",

Despite her fears, Chihiro goes with her parents to see where it leads. They come out in open space where they find what looks like an abandoned theme park. Chihiro's parents find a stall with lots of food prepared and start to eat while Chihiro refuses and goes to investigate a working bath house. As it suddenly gets dark she goes back to her parents to find they have been turned into pigs and suddenly shadows draw over the stalls. Chihiro hides with the help of a boy called Haku. He helps her to stay in the bathhouse by getting her a job (as dictated by Yubaba) and she settles into the resort for Japan's gods and spirits.

The storyline, by the way, follows a girl and how she finds herself in a fantasy world where her parents have been transformed into pigs and spirits and other strange creatures prowl the landscape, and she has to everything she can to stay human and get a way back home, thought she'll need help along the way.

Besides “Bojack Horseman” and “Archer” (though the latter isn’t consistent), it’s one of the few cartoons that features very consistent continuity from one episode to the next, where characters grow and change. A thing that happens in a previous episode remains “having happened” and isn’t abandoned with the standard cartoon reset button (a la “South Park” or “Family Guy”). Moreover, as the show progresses, the individual characters experience profound, personal changes that you can see and appreciate. If all this heady philosophy bores you, don’t worry. The show has the best dialogue I’ve ever heard. It’s sharp and on point. It can be so subtle at times that I’m forced to pause an episode and rewatch a scene over and over to absorb what’s being said. Small details are built into scenes that you will gloss past until someone tells you about that tiny feature on a wall or an article of clothing worn by a character. It’s just that deep.",

Centering around the intergalactic adventures of brilliant, psychopathic and alcoholic scientist Rick and his completely-out-of-his-depth, sidekick nephew Morty, the series by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon was breathtakingly ambitious in its first three seasons, where it took us through a mind-bending maze of parallel universes and timelines, with deeply meta narratives, self-aware characters and sentient plotlines. Having set the bar ridiculously sky high, and garnered a rabid and overly-critical fanbase, the show is now tasked with out-smarting itself - a hellish predicament you see the writers address directly several times (even as they rise to the challenge) in Season 4.",

The show centers on a degenerate relationship between an anxious, socially marginal teen and his lunatic lush of a grandfather who drags him into absurd schemes through time and space. In other words, there are no positive role models here; in fact, the show's foundation is the sadistic emotional control Rick wields over Morty. Violence is graphic albeit in a cartoon way, so you'll see body explosions, gushing wounds, weapon use, and some death. Expect some sexually suggestive stuff as well, with hints at nudity (a girl flashes Morty, although only the top part of her breasts is visible) and some bawdy talk about sexuality.",

His brother Amenadiel (D.B. Woodside) demands that he returns to Hell. When a celebrity is killed in a drive-by, police detective Chloe Decker (Lauren German) investigates. He finds himself strangely attached to her and becomes a police consultant. He has the power to draw out a person's inner desires. She's divorced from fellow detective Dan Espinoza (Kevin Alejandro) and single mom to Trixie. Psychiatrist Linda Martin (Rachael Harris) can't keep her hands off of him. In the second season, his mother Charlotte (Tricia Helfer) arrives with an agenda against his father and Ella Lopez (Aimee Garcia) is the new forensics investigator.",

Until he falls in love with police detective Chloe and becomes her civilian consultant. Each episode brings a new case of murder that Chloe and Lucifer solve by combining her detective and his supernatural abilities, with Chloe not knowing that he really is the Devil. The murder cases are quite original, the ways they are solved are cleverly designed and interesting, and the mutual relations of the characters are entertainingly complex and imbued with great humor. Over time, the series introduces more and more new characters and celestial beings, but it succeeds in maintaining the level of development of characters and their interrelations, and not getting lost in exaggeration and excessive complicating. The characters are diverse, well developed and there's one for everyone's taste. Personally, I prefer Mazikeen, the main torturer in Hell and Lucifer's bodyguard, although they somewhat spoiled her in the third season.",

Lots of stiff contrived grinning by our Luc; sort of a forced smile. That is the extent of the acting for this series. 3. Why w/wings as his only apparent once heavenly attribute do we never see him flying? Would be too weird I guess. And, why our they made of bird feathers - couldn't God find a more powerfully innovative way to get his angels to move about? Speaking of angels it seems there are lots & lots of different religious interpretations of who Lucifer really is in the scheme of things. Not clear in this script! 4. Still sticking w/wings how is it that they can grow/emerge out of his scapulas and through his clothing so effortlessly, and when they retract the clothing is untouched? 5. Lots of lacking attention to detail such as the episode in which a dog walks through blood leaving dog paw prints, but prints look stamped - not smeared as they normally would be. 6. With all the things to investigate on Earth he is spending a lot of time on street level crime. Is this like a punishment? And, always the usual murder/crime scenes found in most every crime series/film. Yawn! 7. The acting reminds me of plastic; can't tell if this series is suppose to be a comedic interpretation of our fallen angel. Oh well, Netflix is up to the task of selling time consuming cheap thrills.",

Although it highlights some elements from the Bible, it's fictional but very thought provoking. If anything, it brings you closer to your beliefs as a Christian so Christians should not be put off by the title. My biggest take away from this series is unconditional love, the love that the two main characters had for one another and the love that existed between all the principal characters. They couldn't have chosen better actors for each role, every actor was perfect for their character. The whole series was highly entertaining, very funny and romantic with minimal nudity and love scenes. Your mind and heart moves with the characters in every episode. Cleverly and brilliantly written, I couldn't recommend it enough.  Although I have completed the whole series, I still go back to some scenes that I can't get out of my mind. My favourite scene of the whole series is Chloe and Lucifer playing the piano in season 1. There was zero physical contact between them but it was the most romantic scene for me. Needless to say that I have seen that scene well, a few times. Well done to the entire team for putting such a memorable show together, I'm so glad I watched it!",

Plot: a teenage detective protoge is turned into a kid by a weird poison and must help solve cases for his girlfriend's bumbling father under a alias until he can find the people who did this to him and recover an antidote. The premise, like I said, sounds kiddie but as the series rolls on things start to get messy and at times, a bit disturbing, but the cases are so ingenously planned out and executed you can't help but watch just to see how Jimmy/Conan will get the jobs done with such a small guise working against him. The animation is pretty good, bright and colorful though dated (eight years old now) but has its own style of anime. The dub isn't bad either, once again Funimation ,the folks doing the recording down here, have hired some excellent voice talent that matches each characters personalty very well though some tend to overact (the junior agency for example). Overall a great series that blends comedy and mystery very well. The only gripe being its very long (over 100 episodes) but still fun to watch. Give it a watch if you need a break from all the action animes or just a fan of Japanese cartoons in general. As Jimmy/Conan always say: With a keen eye for detail, one truth prevails.",

A character (here, it is Raai Laxmi as Akira, a sound designer) is arrested as a suspect, but she claims she is innocent. She has come to a hill station to record the sounds of a few rare birds for a Hollywood project. She finds a Cinderella costume in an antique shop and brings it home and has paranormal experiences. Meanwhile, Ramya (Sakshi Aggarwal), a rich girl is killed and her mother becomes the next target of a ghost. Who is the ghost and why is it on a killing spree? If it had been released some 10 years ago, Cinderella might have come across as mildly engaging. But given that we have had 789 horror films and horror comedies over the past decade, the film hardly comes across as a fresh attempt. There is a flashback that slightly plays around with the Cinderella story... a maid who is harassed by her employers discovering the angel within her after buying a costly gown. A rich, young man (read a prince) falling for her. Raai Laxmi's earnest performance in these portions somewhat carry the film, but Cinderella is otherwise filled with predictable plotting. Even the scares are mainly jump scares that we can anticipate much before they happen. This flashback segment is the strong point of the film, but we also get a tasteless comedy scene featuring Robo Shankar who tries to make us find lines like Priyanka Chopra.. Daily en kooda dhaan saapdraa. His comic lines in this guest appearance are crass and cringe-worthy and only reinforce the notion that it is time our comedians realise that even verbal innuendos are sexual abuse.",

Sure, political correctness , minorities rights, new generations . But the classic fairy tale is used as pretext for a film incapable to convince than must exist. The good things are not insignificant, from the laugh front a fist of scenes to the good job of Minnie Driver , the dress and necklece of Godmother, perfect for the actress interpreting queen Tatiana to some song. But the terms awfull or too easy were not so rare. Sure, I am very subjective , but I think, the meaning of a Disney film is not to be reduced at shock audience but to propose fair, new, smart to wise perspectives about familiar texts.",

Most singing is pretty good, some of it not so much, but it does fine for this type of movie. It is mostly funny, at times absurd, with elaborate production numbers. The biggest divergence is both the prince and Ella are, in different ways, reluctant to accept the traditional roles. He isn't sure he really wants to follow his father as King, she isn't sure she wants to be a wife of a King, maybe being a dress designer would be more fulfilling. Right after release on Amazon streaming this movie has received lots of unjustified, very negative reviews. It isn't a bad movie, in fact it is very well made and interesting for any viewer in the right frame of mind. It isn't my type of movie, I'll probably not re-watch it, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. A rating of 5 or 6 is probably just about right.",

Well, sadly, that was all just a triumph for optimism over, well, just about anything... It's terrible. Good looking, well produced, but terrible. Am I the only person left alive who is fed up being shouted at by Edina Menzel? Pierce Brosnan demonstrated in Mamma Mia (2008) that he is happy to play parts with his tongue in his cheek, but here I fear he must have cringed when he saw; likewise Minnie Driver and a whole host of British comedians led by the ubiquitously un-talented James Corden. Billy Porter tries a different take on the fairy godmother character but features all to sparingly to make much impact on an otherwise extremely pedestrian interpretation that reached it's nadir with the cute but totally wooden pairing of Nicholas Galitzine (Freddie Mercury would spin in his grave) and Camila Cabello. Sorry, maybe if I were 6 years old and had nothing to compare this with, I'd not be so harsh - but I'm not and this is poor, really poor...",

The setting and idea, grab your attention at the outset. Saif Ali Khan speaking an unknown village dialect with an anglicised accent, in that unique Saif voice is unintentionally funny. His knack of going for unheroic characters, off the beaten track is admirable. But intent and attempt can be amusing to a point. His performance leaves you conflicted here. He comes across as an odd mix of trying too hard to be funny and not trying at all to be invested in his character. Arjun and Yami are sincere, the only actors to have understood the assignment. Jacqueline and Saif seem more like tourists in Dharamshala, who chose to act in this film as a pastime.",

There is even a ‘pardafash’ moment midway through, but I won't get into that. The mismatched duo – Vibhooti is a rapscallion and Chiraunji is the sort of person who'd have carried the burden of family expectations in his youth – are in the ‘tantric' business. Fortunately for them, they were born in a society whose very survival hinges on superstitions. Business, therefore, is booming.",

I waited a long time to start watching it but once I started I binge watched the first four seasons. So yes I admit it, it is addictive, you can't help to want to know what will happen in the next episode. That said the plot itself is sometimes very far fetched, in other words it would never happen like that in real life. The Professor thinks about every move the police will make, and that's fine, but sometimes it's just very unlikely and just a bit exaggerated. For that alone I can't rate this, for the rest excellent series, with a higher score. The cast is really good though, every actor did a great job, from the most annoying one to the heroes. Everyone will have their favorite character, some will die and some will survive, that what makes this show really entertaining, the not knowing what will happen. I strongly advise you watch this show in it's original language Spanish instead of watching it dubbed. It only adds to the excellent acting. I once tried to watch a dubbed thing, it's just awful, and I really don't get what people like about lips being out of synch. Can't wait for season five, let's bring it on.pect everything from projectile vomit and wall-crawling ghouls to a creepy kid and a haunted forest – stops it from ever being more than a middling film that aims to please the masses.

The German army was coming and the combined British and French forces were trapped with little apparent chance to escape. And, as an army of over 300,000 Brits dug in and waited, the Luftwaffe began chipping away at them....and ultimately would have killed and/or captured them all if it wasn't for a rag-tag flotilla of private boats which hastily arrived and spirited away about 80-90% of the men.",

There's actually very little blood, but there are some drowning scenes which are intense and awful. Now I am not saying don't watch it...just be prepared.",

            body:"Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts. 'Dunkirk' had me interested in it from the get go. Not just because Nolan was the director, though he is to me one of the 'appreciated' directors than a personal favourite, and, while all his films range from decent to outstanding, again from personal opinion only 'Memento' is a film without faults, so like him and his films but don't consider them the best thing since sliced bread. There was also the involvement of Hans Zimmer, who has penned some great scores (both in his collaborations with Nolan, being a regular, and elsewhere) and a cast that includes Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy. Plus 'Dunkirk' was based off one of the most disastrous events in British wartime history, actually cited by Winston Churchill as 'a colossal military disaster'.",

If you remember Walter Pidgeon took his small craft out and said he would be returning the next day. You then see his boat joining other small craft and then there's an armada of them heading down the Thames and out to sea. They were heading for Dunkirk and were going right up to the beaches where the large naval vessels couldn't go and taking several hundred thousand British soldiers and a few French who later became the basis for the Free French army headed by Charles DeGaulle.",

I have a bit of hesitation with the portrayal of some of the soldiers. The Cillian Murphy character is perfectly fine as a soldier suffering PTSD. If he's the only one, it would be a very compelling portrayal but Nolan puts in too many. I'm also willing to accept Tommy's lies to escape. It's not until the beached boat where there seems to be a problem. I can understand the Lord of the Flies mentality. With Germans taking potshots at them, there are two logical moves. They could either go out and fight or hide and wait. They have guns and fighting is possible. There is no logical reason to kick out Frenchie which would only prove their existence in the boat. They are acting irrationally which is excusable but Tommy needs to call it out. I would also want a separate section with soldiers fighting rear guard action. Tommy's tale could be so different and more action packed if he stayed to fight for a little while. Overall, Nolan's film-making skills are undeniable and this is a compelling exploration of this historical event. ",

            body:"I would concur with many that the film was overhyped. Nevertheless, to give something as breathtaking in its cinematic efforts a one or two is ridiculous. I guess people who are into war film are not unlike the fanboys in the Marvel world. This is an intense film. I'll admit that if I had to depend on it to explain the actual events of the Dunkirk rescue, I would say it was lacking. It's no 'Tora Tora Tora' or 'The Longest Day' which depict the breadth of the subject of war. It focuses more on fragile individuals who are more realistic. One reviewer referred to two of the men as cowards, doing whatever they could to stay alive. As if those who were trapped by the Germans wouldn't do whatever they could to stay alive. Yes, there is a bit of tackiness. These are fictional characters. There's lots of heroism to go around. There is cowardice. This is war and war is not desirable. Still, with a big picture attempt it would have been much better.",

            body: "This review is being written by a 46 year-old guy. I mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important, as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie more--and can take the fast-paced action and frenetic pace. I assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film. Just something to consider as you read this. As for the movie, I'll be up front about the fact that I did NOT love this film. It's just not the sort of movie I'd usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go. I am glad I did, however, as I really could respect the movie in many ways. First, the story is wildly original (though, also quite confusing). Other than the Matrix films, I can't think of anything that even comes close to it in style. Second, the production looked and sounded great. The music was intense and worked great with the amazing, totally amazing, special effects. Third, it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are NOT light-weights and could act. Leonardo DiCaprio is no longer the pretty young thing he was in 'Titanic'--his maturity and grit were welcome. Also, seeing the kid from 'Third Rock' suddenly playing an action hero was great--you'd barely recognize him--or the other grown child actors. Fourth, I loved the ending--it really pulled everything together very well.",

After seeing it for myself, I thought it was a good film, but not as good as I was led to believe. Out of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen, Inception didn't wow me as much as Memento and The Prestige, and it is one of my least favourites of his so far. Does that mean the film is bad? No, I am just saying I do not think it is Nolan's best as I have heard people say. My main problem with Inception was the lack of emotional attachment, I do understand completely anybody who says it is emotionally cold. Particularly in the characters, they are written and acted well, but not much is done to make us empathise with them and their predicaments. I loved the idea of the story, it was clever and somewhat original and it did start very compelling and intriguing, but as the film progresses it does become rather convoluted and I found myself losing a little interest. Also, the pace is uneven, as the characters became more cold and the story more convoluted, the film really does start to drag until the conclusion where the film does thankfully pick up.",

            body:"The 'kiss' platform of recent years to keep it simple and stupid has pretty much ruined movies to a point as it's rare when one can walk into a movie and have a real workout on your brain. Sure, our eyes and ears are treated to amazing sites and loud noises each and every week and some would say this causes the brain just to lose any type of reality, which might be the reason certain people (cough Lohan, Hilton and countless others) are able to be hot stories while better, more worthwhile events are simply overlooked. If one doesn't want to use their brain then it's best to stay away from this thing. It's best not to know too much about the story but it deals with a troubled man (Leonardo DiCaprio) who has made it a job to break into people's dreams and steal their ideas. However, due to a personal tragedy, he is forced to take a job doing the opposite, which is breaking into a man's dream to plant an idea. That's pretty much all you need to know, storywise, as director/writer Nolan will deliver the rest and while the end result wasn't a pure masterpiece to me, there's no way you can deny the power it does contain. Dreams have always played an interesting part in movies but no other has taken you this far into them and delivered such incredible ideas. Not only does the screenplay deliver a lot to think about but we also get plenty of action and amazing scenes of destruction. The trailer showed people just a little pinch of a city turning upside down but seeing the full sequence was something truly amazing. Other amazing sequences was the entire final hour when our group of dream breakers must enter a multiple layer of dreams with one damaging effect after another. If you're familiar with Nolan then you already know what he can do and there's no question the man has talent but it is something special that a film like this could be pulled off at all. When you're dealing with multiple characters in multiple spaces and in multiple dream zones it would be easy and common for things to just fall apart under their own weight. It's very difficult to keep you guessing from one moment to another without things either falling apart or getting so complicated that the viewer simply gives up on the film and moves on. The amazing thing is that Nolan never lets up on the gas and instead just delivers one more bit of story on top of the next and I thought it was amazing that he could keep the viewing coming along for the ride and never lose us. I think some people are going to not understand what's going on or be able to figure out the multiple levels but when you kick back and think about what you've seen I think most will see that the maze had an entrance and an exit and nothing came as a cheat. DiCaprio delivers yet another wonderful performance but he's got a terrific cast around him including Ellen Page, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Cilliam Murphy, Pete Postlethwaite and a great return from Tom Berenger. Each actor does fine work in their roles and certainly help the story move along. The nature of the story is a very good one but the visual effects are just as good. Looking at all the action and amazing effects makes one really appreciate the acting, directing and story even more simply because they didn't get lost behind everything else that was going on. I don't think there's any question that one needs more than a single viewing to catch everything happening here but that's certainly not a bad thing since each viewing will deliver bits and pieces that will probably take the film into directions that you didn't think were there.",

This film is certainly a tour de force. It requires engagement at every step. LIke most works of art, it doesn't give it all away. I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time. First of all, the premise is wonderfully engaging. Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened, only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends. While confusing, it's exciting. The amazing thing is that the director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness. We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss. We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed. We care about the matrix of the dream levels.

My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn't take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn't quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in 'The Avengers'. Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren't fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth...",

            body:"Superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right, and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldn't be totally enamoured with it(as seen in a lot of the negative comments, a lot of them being condescending though- enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already!- and some not even worthy of being called reviews) Avengers Assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right. True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox.

            body:"I'm not really a comic book fan, so after hearing the constant hype about this film for a couple of years I really wasn't too fussed when it finally appeared on TV. I went into it expecting not to like it much, and indeed the first hour seemed to me middling at best: some mildly lame comedy, a whole lot of posturing, and a silly storyline involving silly characters. Then things changed. They started to pick up, and the action started hitting home. Then all hell broke loose with a climax that felt like it lasted a whole hour, an hour packed with kaiju-style mayhem as New York found itself subjected to an alien invasion. And I was wowed. Never before has it been possible to depict such constant, wide-scale mayhem, but with the improvement of CGI technology it's finally up there on screen with all of its glory. And yes, I ended up liking MARVEL'S AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. What's not to like, really? The whole feel is kept light and there are so many larger-than-life characters that you end up having a ball with it regardless. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is my favourite character by far - Ruffalo is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana or Edward Norton - but Chris Evans's Captain America comes a close second. Sure, I see this film for what it is: a mindless piece of crowd-pleasing, overblown CGI mayhem, replete with a silly, buffoonish bad guy - but at the same time I can't help but getting caught up for the ride.",

Downey has already shown that he's a movie star. He could power a whole franchise all by himself but the Avengers is more than just a one man team. This is a quintessential Joss Whedon Scooby gang, and he's great at the snappy dialog and friend-hate comradry. This is a whole team of heroes working together. Because of its timing, this will be compared to The Dark Knight Rises. Most seems to give TDKR more credit because of its darker grittier tone. Both are great but I like Avengers better. Honestly, TDKR is inferior to TDK. There are logic problems with TDKR. There are too many comic-book moves in that film. It's melodramatic in its emotionally manipulations. The Avengers is simply better written. Its dialog is better. It may be simplistic but it's more fun.",

I've become abundantly aware that there are legions of fans out there who can't wait to see what Hollywood is doing with the classic comic book characters. But after three Iron Men and now this, I see a sameness in them all, and I'm not equipped properly to enjoy them as I should. I'm still rating this pretty high because it is amazing to look at, the special effects are beyond belief, and some of the characters have some dimension. That said, I think I would need a manual to really get the true impact of each character, what his or her powers are, and how they fit together. There is always some evildoing bad guy who has some history with the others. This is what makes comics what they are (I read lots of comics as a kid, so I do understand the milieu). When you get right down to it, however, they seem to rely mostly on beating each other over the head with whatever is handy. It's like watching professional wrestling which is sort of comic bookish in its own way. It's a cast of characters what represent simple things, both good and evil. I'll leave these to the kids and continue to watch movies with complex characters and clever story lines.",

While some people claim to hate CGI, there are those of us who consider it another tool to make a movie, but think it can be misused. I like a lot of superhero movies. I have been enjoying most of the Marvel Studio movies, but some are better than others. It turns out I like the big fight sequence in the first Avengers movie because it clearly takes place around Grand Central. I can relate to it, since I am a native New Yorker. I take pleasure in seeing how the Helmsley Palace tunnels are used, and the Pershing Overpass. The Spiderman movie with the elevated train along Canal Street annoyed me. There are lots of movies that use 'movie geography' that makes no sense and they don't all use CGI. There was a Michael Keaton vehicle about twenty years ago called THE HARD WAY which annoyed me with its nonsensical geography. The problem is not CGI; It's using CGI or other techniques to enable bad scripts.",

But the real world of that Maine prison has some bizarre rules of its own and there's a whole new reality within those walls. In the tradition of Cool Hand Luke and Birdman Of Alcatraz comes Tim Robbins who was a banker on the outside, but when he caught his wife cheating on him with a golf pro from their country club, he's convicted of putting eight bullets in them, four apiece and tried and sentenced to two consecutive life terms in Shawshank prison. Like Luke and Bob Stroud he works out his own rehabilitation and rebels against the prison system. He may be a con, but Robbins still has all his knowledge of finances and pretty soon he's made himself quite invaluable to the warden and the rest of the staff at the prison. At the same time he and the cell block scrounger Morgan Freeman develop a close personal relationship. In the end they beat the system in a most unique way.",

SHAWSHANK often shows up as the 'best film of all time' on various movie lists - including here on the IMDb - and, whilst I don't necessarily agree about that, it is a very good film indeed, near flawless in fact. Every technical element of the film is spot-on, from direction to music, editing, and acting; Morgan Freeman delivers his best ever performance whilst Tim Robbins shows us what a great character actor he is. Even better, for a genre fan like me, is seeing acting favourites like Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Brian Libby, and James Whitmore all appearing in the film together and playing more than just stock good or bad guy roles. Every actor is great here, and the script (which sticks closely to King's writing) is nigh-on perfect. Emotion, thrills, drama, and the triumph of the human spirit are all present in this movie, which is one of the greatest prison flicks ever.",

He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman). Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth. If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable.",

Teach your kids strong values and then it shouldn't be an issue while watching cause the child knows it is just a movie and they know right from wrong. If everyone jumped off a bridge would you do it too? This movie is great to start asking questions to your child has this stuff happened to you or someone you know? How would you of handled it differently? You ask your kid you know all the different ways you could handle these situations presented in this movie correctly, right? Kid answers no well then lets talk about this. Kids need to be comfortable talking about sex and drugs or seeing it on t.v. My mother sheltered me from these things, I got pregnant at 15 years old. So there ya go on what the results will be from sheltering your children. Who do you think I going to teach your kid about these issues? Seeing it in a movie make it more real and relatable.",

Jabami, white dressed girl with long hair, and lastly the person who is called the head of the village)",

This season gets straight to the point and introduces new villain named Kenny that turns out to be somehow related to Levi. There are many parties trying to get Eren and Historia. For what reason? It is yet to be reveald. Mystery we all feel in love with is still there and there are even more questions, but don't let that distract you from the fact that this season ,even tho is only few episodes in, already has some major reveals in it. Pacing is amazing and i wasn't bored for a moment while watching. Things are only getting more interesting when Erwin reveals how he's planning to ovethrow the governmant without using the force. This season has a very refreshing and different plot compared to previous ones as we can see from the lack of titans and focuse on the issues inside the walls rather than beyond. However it's still as, if not more interesting than before. There is world buidling,mystery,back stabbing and some major questions answered which there is hopfully more to come.",

There was a time when I didn't like Friends very much, then again it was also at a time when I wasn't into sit-coms. My brother and sister, who absolutely adore the show suggested I should try the show again, so I did. Well, my initial reaction of the show was wrong, this show is great, it is funny and smart with appealing characters. It is by far one of the better American sit-coms and I do think it is better than Everybody Loves Raymond",

It's a major stretch adding it to the other movie and I was not scared and very quickly I could care less what happened. A true dud!

            body: "What a great fucking description for this movie this site has. 'Before the Conjuring, there was ANNABELLE'. Gee, thanks guys! You know your film is lackluster when a LIFETIME ORIGINAL TV MOVIE is better than this. Yes, I thought Big Driver was a considerably better film. Perhaps considerably is a strong word, as I wouldn't call Big Driver a good film, but for what it was going for, and the audience it wanted to attain, it did a good job at giving the people what they wanted to see. This one, on the other hand, whoo boy, this was a rough movie to sit through. It gets two stars because the film is certainly watchable enough, Alfre Woodward is excellent here, and it has some decent scares. But this just seems to borrow heavily from other films like The Conjuring itself, Insidious, Paranormal Activity, Rosemary's Baby, among others. As you can see, the films that I've mentioned here all have one thing in common, and that is that they are all better than Annabelle. I don't think the film has one original bone in its body.",

The action, the character development, the emotional moments, the score, the animation or be it just the writing in general, Demon Slayer is on a whole different level. I went through a number of emotions watching it, and it felt like I was on one wild ride from episode 1 to 26. The mood keeps varying from time to time, but the tempo never drops and with intriguing characters, it only gets better and better with every episode.",

            body:"Demon Slayer: Mugen Train is by far one the best anime movies to ever be released. I remember seeing this movie when it came out in theaters in April, and it was truly one of the best cinema-going experiences I’ve ever witnessed. It’s entertaining the whole way through, and is enough to leave you extremely satisfied. Picking up directly after the end of season 1 of the TV series, the movie follows our heroes as they board a train where the Lower One of the Twelve Kizuki lurks in the shadows. The film has some amazing character development and introduces the Flame Hashira; Kyōjurō Rengoku who had briefly appeared in the series prior to the movie. All characters are given true personality through the voice over performances, which is enough to make you sympathize with them. While all the characters have their moments to shine; Nezuko and Zenitsu in particular, the three who still the show are Tanjiro, Rengoku, and the Lower Moon One: Enmu Tamio. Tanjiro and Rengoku serve as the emotional hearts of the film and both are given plenty of character development throughout the film’s two hour runtime. Enmu on the other hand, is the perfect villain for our heroes to face. In both the sub and dub voices he captures your attention, and his words are absolutely bone-chilling and entertaining to hear and watch. The animations are absolutely spectacular and truly add to the scope of the movie. More so than any other anime film, spectacle is the clear key here. The film provides you with eye-popping visuals that will surly make you wonder in awe. The soundtrack is without a doubt beautiful, with some tracks appropriately upbeat and thrilling, and others somber and captivating. Overall I highly recommend this movie for anyone who is anime fan. If you’ve seen the TV series or read the manga, you’ll definitely find this film an immense crowd-pleaser. To put simply, definitely check out this movie. Beyond all recognition, this movie is the definition of a masterpiece.",

            body:"Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train is one of the best anime films of all-time period. This movie absolutely deserves the praise its getting. I have a lot of list to explain why this is one of the best films of all-time. Spoilers for those who haven't watched it yet. The Story: the story stays perfectly faithful to the manga version. While in the manga, Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, and Inosuke went to the train to find Rengoku to ask about Tanjiro's ability, the movie version changes as a mission for the four to aid him in hunting down the demon attacking the train. However, most of the moments in this movie are incredibly faithful to the manga, showing how well the writers were perfectly staying faithful to the manga. The Visuals: As expected from many studios, the animation gives us stunning visuals, with the train's design, the battles, and even the design of (SPOILER) Enmu's train fusing body. the animation must have taken days, so the designers hard works pays off as we blessed with beautiful animation. The battles in particular, are praise-worthy, as we see the characters' fighting styles once more, and the animation we are gifted to see. The Characters and voice acting: Like last time, Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, and Inosuke becomes more likeable than ever from their funny moments to their epic battles, it's really nice to see them again. both the Japanese and English voice actors still do a splendid job with their roles. the villains, Enmu and (SPOILER) Akaza, are also incredible great villains as they give our heroes a major struggle. Their Japanese and English voice acting are also done well. However, beside Tanjiro, we have to give the critical acclaim praise towards one of the greatest supporting characters, Kyojuro Rengoku, the Flame Hashira. In the tv series, we see Rengoku and what type of a man he is. The movie even gives us a much more clearer type of person Rengoku truly is. He's incredibly kind, heroic, noble, and honorable as he fights to protect mankind and always smiles. His voice actors, both the Japanese and English done a perfect job of Rengoku. The Music Score: The music is just... wow. Incredibly beautiful. The action-music, the heart-warming/tearjerker-music, just any type of music this movie throw at you will give you such emotions. Homura by LISA is an Oscar-worthy song to listen to. But if you do listen, and somewhat understand what she's singing about, prepare for tears. And now... the BIG ONE. BIG SPOILER ALERT! Read at your own risk. Tanjiro and Rengoku: These two are the biggest main characters of this movie in my opinion. And for good reasons. We see that Tanjiro wishes to learn about his ability, Hinokami Kagura Dance and Rengoku, who sees great interest in him, offers to become his mentor. Tanjiro and Rengoku are almost similar in a way, as they both have siblings who they deeply love and are both honorable and heroic warriors, who wish to end Muzan and bring peace to mankind. And just as we thought, that after Tanjiro and Inosuke finally defeat and killed Enmu, the heroes earn their victory, the Upper Moon 3, Akaza arrives and tries to recruit Rengoku while Akaza tries to kill Tanjiro and the 200 passengers, including Nezuko, Zenitsu, and Inosuke. And after a fierce fight, Rengoku ultimately loses his life, but not before encouraging Tanjiro to lift his heart ablaze and giving out one last smile on his face. This greatly affects Tanjiro, as he's deeply sadden by his death. It show how much influence Rengoku had on Tanjiro. Overall, this is one of the greatest films ever to be seen and I hope you all enjoy it! LIFT YOUR HEART ABLAZE! 🔥🔥🔥",

            body:"This movie was absolutely stunning with breathtaking art and animation and a gripping storyline. It did not disappoint one bit. The music in each scene set the atmosphere and tone perfectly, at one point giving a throwback to Kamado Tanjiro no Uta using the same music and voice with different lyrics that set a similar yet different tone, which struck a chord in my heart as it was used in a serious and sad moment. There aren't any words for how beautiful the scenery and animation were in small moments. (for a while I was seriously convinced that they were using 120 fps for a few parts lol) I definitely recommend seeing this movie either at the theater or watching it at home once it is available to buy. I also recommend stopping by the restroom before you watch because you don't want to get stuck not wanting to leave to go haha.(I recommend bringing some tissues too..... for no reason...) Have a great day!",
